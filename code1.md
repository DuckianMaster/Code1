Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code
during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on a project
simultaneously without interfering with each other's changes, providing features
for branching, merging, and version history.

 Node.js
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that executes
JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is designed to build scalable
network applications and provides a rich library of modules for various
functionalities.

TypeScript Compiler (tsc)
The TypeScript Compiler (`tsc`) translates TypeScript code, a statically
typed superset of JavaScript, into plain JavaScript. It checks for type
errors at compile time, enhancing code quality and maintainability. The
compiled JavaScript can run in any environment that supports JavaScript.

Visual Studio Code (VSC)
Visual Studio Code is a powerful, open-source code editor developed by
Microsoft. It supports various programming languages and comes with
features like syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging, and
integrated Git control. It is highly customizable through extensions.

 Visual Studio Code Extensions
Extensions enhance the functionality of Visual Studio Code, enabling 
additional features like language support, debugging tools, and version 
control integration. They are available from the Visual Studio Code 
Marketplace and can be easily installed and managed within the editor.

 ESLint
ESLint is a static code analysis tool used to identify and fix
problematic patterns in JavaScript and TypeScript code. It helps
enforce coding standards and improve code quality by catching
errors and enforcing consistent code style.

 Git Graph
Git Graph is a Visual Studio Code extension that provides a visual
representation of your Git repository. It allows developers to see
branches, commits, and the relationship between them, making it
easier to manage and understand the history and structure of the project.
